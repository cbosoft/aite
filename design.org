* Program Structure
 - server
   - server simulates universe and processes events
   - events are generated by "colonials" (players and computer players) and by
     "nature": natural events like solar decay, planets colliding,
     atmospheric/climate changes, and so on
 - client
   - controls an agent
   - colonial decides a "strategy": a short or long term set of orders for the
     colony to pursue
   - can be simple "focus on expansion" or more complex "focus on expansion
     unless resources are low, then focus on gathering and discovery". This
     will be defined through a simple "scripting" language
 - Universe
   - contains everything (i.e. Galaxies)
   - main "sim" runner class
   - contains a list of Colonials operating in the Universe
 - Galaxy
   - container of (solar) Systems
   - Galaxies move through the universe
 - System
   - container of Planets
   - Colonies settle Planets and inhabit Systems
 - Planet
   - has properties (size, mass, temperature, pressure) which affect, generally,
     survivability.
   - Contains slew of elements which then dictate climate
   - Has History which defines the *cultural* things that can be found,
     depending on the age of the planet
 - History
   - A generated set of list of connected events that have happened over the
     course of the planet's lifetime
   - Longer the history, the more the events develop
   - History may add to what the colony can gain from the planet (lifeforms,
     unusually abundant minerals, abandonded technologies, other signs of life)
 - Historical Event
   - One piece of a historical story
* Gameplay
  - Colony starts on a planet
  - Exploration will (generate if necessary) nearby planets and solar systems
  - Technological advancement required for exploration *efficiently*
  - Focusing on resource gathering will limit lifespan of the planet, perhaps
    irrevocably altering atmosphere in a harmful manner
  - Game tracks colony size, resources (material, energy, food, culture,
    knowledge, religion), mood (colony will have desires), habitat
  - player will, for the most part, be in the dark about this.
  - contact between player and game is in the form of small digests, updating on
    happenings in the colony and results of current set of orders
  - however, player can take the time to explore their colony: see what's
    happening, what the mood is, and so on. This is an opportunity ripe for
    checking out discoveries the people have made, changes and updates to
    society and so on.
** Technology
** Culture
** Expansion
* (Chemical) Elements
  - Everything in the universe will come from the periodic table
  - Gases, metals, some liquids, combinations; all form to make the basis of
    the planets, satellites, the universe
  - combinations are important as this describes the chemistry and makeup of
    the planet (water+carbon-chains? life!) Other forms of life?
* Planets
  - climate is defined by temperature, density, atmospheric pressure, and
    elemental composition.
  - averages give and overall view; highs and lows give some indication of what
    kind of biomes are on the planet
  - atmospheric pressure defines whether there is an atmosphere to begin with,
    but also how much of it. Large pressure differential signifies winds or
    storms.
  - components of the planet, the moisture, the air will depend on the pressure
    and temperature. There could be rivers of water; or of molten glass. There
    could be nitrogen rich atmosphere, or there could be hydrogen plasma.
  - Fauna and flora should be on the planet, if sustainable. for the most part,
    there should only be life where oxygen and carbon exist. Only in rare
    circumstances should exceptional (non carbon-based) flora/fauna be found.
  - The planet should have *history*: if it can sustain life, there should be the
    possibility that it has sustained life. There should be archeaological
    finds, or other signs.
  - A planet visited by a colony can be described. The *detail* of the
    description will depend on the technological advancement of the colony, the
    time spent on the planet, and their *focus* (i.e. do they care enough about
    culture or history to look for archeaology?)

* Solar Systems
** Asteroids
** Stars
** Black Holes
** Nebulae
* Galaxies
* Colonies

  Colonies are groups of people seeking to explore and expand through the
  territories of the universe.

  A colony will grow and thrive on a planet, but will eventually need to move
  onward, seeking new lands and materials.

  They can only explore where they can; their *technology* will hold them
  back if they can't survive on a planet, or if they can't detect if a planet
  contains what they desire.

** Statistics

   Colony stats are split into three groups: Population, Technology,
   Culture. Each group has different effects on the effectiveness of your
   society. Setting activities for the colony will grow or shrink a set of
   stats, and alter the course of development for your colony!

*** Population
    
    Population stats covers the size and survivability of a colony. Things
    like growth rate (birth rate - death rate), resilience, diversity, and mood
    are affected by the technology you have and the culture available.

    Number is the pure size of the colony; just the number of people. Having
    more people will allow activities to proceed faster as more people work
    towards them, but will increase reliance on natural resources.

*** Technology

    As an isolated colony on a harsh exoplanet, there is probably little more
    important than a technology for survival. Tech stats govern travel speed,
    survivability in limbo --- the space between --- as well as ability to learn
    new technologies, assimilate alien technology (if there is any ;) and so on.

    Initially, a colony is placed on a survivable planet. As the colony grows,
    it is necessary to expand out, thus new technologies are required to
    facilitate survival on oppressive high-G planets; on titanic gas giants; or
    scorching hot solar neighbours.

*** Culture

    Cultural stats govern the non-technology creations of a colony. Religion is
    not inherent to a colony, but may arise naturally as time goes on, or
    perhaps events will lead to belief...

    Artistic and religiious output will, generally, positively affect a colony,
    but only a small percentage of the population can work towards either of
    these goals.

    Peace is the result of having enough to do but not toomuch, enough food, and
    not being overcrowded. Having a high peace stat ensures maximum
    efficiency. However, what if working people a little too hard is the better
    option? (reduced efficiency, but longer hours = more work output?)

** Activity
   - A colony may engage in activity to pursue a goal. Activity might be
     research of a technology, investigation of surroundings, exploration etc
   - These are updated with time. e.g. having a portion of the population on
     research duty will result in a continuous advance
   - Some activities are on going, others are limited (more like temporary push)
   - In-game, these are seen as like governing policy; the people are told that
     /this/ is the best route for success.
   - There may be dissenters, and people may ignore policy. This will scale with
* History
  - planets and systems will have a coherent history; planets in the same
    system, if one supports life then it probably does and the other planets
    will have been colonised.
  - These xeno-colonies will perhaps linger on, or perhaps they will be
    gone. Either way there will be evidence of their existence.
