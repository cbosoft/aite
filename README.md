# Àite Domhainn: a strategy game for the patient

In Àite, you control a colony of people plonked our there, in space. You have
limited supplies, you have no backup. But you do have time, lots of it. You will
slowly build up your colony, through the generations, conquering the worlds,
systems, galaxies of deep space. You will need to uncover new technologies to
grow and expand, you will need to explore and inquisit new worlds. Who knows
what you can uncover on the next world?

From Scottish Gaelic, Àite Domhainn; a profound situation.

# WIP: intended features:

  - Procedural and massive

    An immense procedurally generated universe will be at hand, limited only by
    the size of the variable describing the position of galaxies within.
    Galaxies (solar) systems, planets, stars, nebulae, asteroid fields, black
    holes, gas giants, red dwarfs, neutron stars, binary stars all generated
    on-the-fly as exploration proceeds. This will be a consistent system
    however, once generated the system is Real, and can be found by other
    curious explorers.

  - "real" time

    The game runs, on a server, 24/7. In game time is much faster than life, so
    that one hour is many years in-game. This allows the player to plan for and
    then see the results of generation-spanning plans.

  - Projects

    Colony is guided through multi-year projects: "explore that system",
    "investigate archaeology of that", "research new power generation technique"

  - History

    Each generated world will have a history that can be uncovered - if the
    curiousity moves you. Historical finds may aid in the development of the
    colony...

  - Social development

    People in space are still people. Social desires will need to be met, or
    there will be unrest. Things like culture, art, religion will make a colony
    happy. Authority and harsh rule may artificially aid productivity, but could
    come at a price...
